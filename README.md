# Example MCP SSE Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation, enabling server-sent events (SSE) based communication.

## Overview

Example MCP SSE Server provides a Model Context Protocol implementation that allows for real-time communication using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
It's designed to work with applications and provides a standardized way of managing and communicating with models and resources.

## Features

- Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication
- Resource templating and management

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
- Yarn package manager (can be changed easily)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yunusemredilber/express-mcp-sse-server.git
cd express-mcp-sse-server
yarn install
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

To start the server in development mode:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will run the server with the MCP inspector for debugging.

To start the server in production mode:

```bash
yarn start
```

By default, the server runs on port 3001. You can override this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=5000 yarn start
```

### Endpoints

- `/sse` - SSE endpoint for establishing persistent connections
- `/messages` - Endpoint for sending messages to the MCP server
